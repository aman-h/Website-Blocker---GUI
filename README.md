# Website-Blocker---GUI

This is a GUI program made with Python tkinter library
which blocks the entered website by modifiying the Windows system 'hosts' file.

This is to be run in a cmd with admin privileges.
The blocked website would be inaccessible to the specific system it was done on.

<!-- Unblock option coming soon...-->
